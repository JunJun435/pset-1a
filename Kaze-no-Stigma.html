<p>Info: Kazuma Yannagi was born in a household that had strong ties with
	fire spirits. Kazuma, being the only person in the household who
	couldn't use any fire attacks. At the age of 16, he was bannished
	from his family after losing to his cousin in a match. Four years
	later he comes back to his family as a powerful wind user. I highly
	recommend this anime to anyone that wants to have a taste of animations
	from the 2000's.</p>
