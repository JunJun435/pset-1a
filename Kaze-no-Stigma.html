<p>Info: Kazuma Yannagi was born in a household that had strong ties with fire spirits. Kazuma, being the only person in the household who couldn't use any fire attacks. At the age of 16, he was bannished from his family after losing to his cousin in a match. Four years later he comes back to his family as a powerful wind user. I highly recommend this anime to anyone that wants to have a taste of animations from the 2000's.</p>
