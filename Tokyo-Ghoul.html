<p>Info: Highschooler Kaneki Ken finally gets to go on a date with Rize Kamishiro, who he see's everyday at the coffee shop. Upon coming to the end of their date, he was lead to an empty construction site by Rize. He then realizes that she is a ghoul, human eating creatures, when she takes out her kagune, weapons that comes out the back of ghouls. He is tortured almost to death when pipes from the highest floor right onto Rize killing her instantly. Doctors were able to save Kaneki by transferring some of Rize's organs into Kaneki turning him into a half-ghoul. This anime is really interesting and by far one of the best I've watched so you should definitely watch it. </p>
