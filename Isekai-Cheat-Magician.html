<p>Info: This anime all starts out with regular highschool student Taichi Nishimura
	and Rin Azuma being summoned to another world. The moment they landed in
	this mysterious world, they were attacked by flesh-eating monsters.
	Luckily, they were saved by adventurers and taken to a nearby town and
	to register as an adventurer so that they can find a way to get home.
	They were tested on their magic capability and shocked everyone with
	their insane amount of magic. This anime is still on-going at this
	moment (9/26/2019), this anime is great for you if you enjoy watching
	an anime with over-powered characters.</p>
